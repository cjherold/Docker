                            There are three main types of services offered over the Internet. Each type of service has its own scale and use, so deciding which type of service is best suited to meet your needs can be the most important step in beginning to utilize the benefits of Cloud Services.

                        <p class="card-p">
                            Infrastructure as a Service is the broadest and most flexible service offered over the Internet. IaaS offers computation, data storage, and networking services over the Internet for businesses to utilize without the need to maintain their own physical systems. This is very useful for businesses that are growing quickly. A new business may want to focus their time, money, and IT department on continuing to develop their core business rather than building up a local server farm. With IaaS this business can hire an outside company to run their servers for them. This also helps with overall cost, as service providers only charge for the amount of processing and data storage the compnay uses, making IaaS a very scalable assest to have for any business.

                        <p class="card-p">
                            Platform as a Service takes care of all the services offered by IaaS and more. PaaS also provides development tools, database management systems, and middleware to the customer. PaaS is often used by developer communities wishing to maintain their own software and applications, but who would like the rest of the services maintained fof them by the cloud service provider. With PaaS maintaining all of the licensing and updating for their development environments, programmers are free to work with large teams, always knowing they will all be running the correct systems together.

                        <p class="card-p">
                            Software as a Service is the most extensive service offered over the Internet as there is almost nothing for the cumtomer to have to manage themselves. SaaS is a completely packaged, ready-to-use application. E-mail, Point of Sale systems, and Google Docs are all examples of SaaS. These applications often store data to the cloud for the user so that the user's information can be accessed from any machine connected to the Internet. Almost all companies use some sort of SaaS nowdays and they are usually fairly inexpensive and easy to use.
